# Medical-Review-Crawler
Quick and handy Python web crawler used for a medical paper to crawl and parse Yelp and Google Map Reviews for Plastic Surgery into a CSV.

The Yelp Python script only requires a BeautifulSoup and the parse library installed.

The Google Maps Reviews Python script requires BeautifulSoup, parse library, and Selenium (+ Chromedriver) installed too since Google Maps Reviews load results dynamically through JavaScript.

As of now, the Realself Python script does not currently work as it is to-be implemeneted since I have not figured out how to bypass the anti-crawling reCAPTCHA check.
